# Scan project with archguardian

When the user asks to scan or analyze the project:

1. Run `npx archguardian scan --format json`
2. Parse findings grouped by severity (errors > warnings > info)
3. For each finding explain what the rule checks, show the code, suggest a fix
4. If many findings exist, summarize top issues first
5. Offer to auto-fix (`npx archguardian fix`) or suppress false positives
6. If first-time adoption with many findings, suggest `npx archguardian scan --update-baseline`
