# Suppress archguardian findings

When the user wants to suppress a false positive:

1. Prefer rule-specific over blanket: `// archguard-ignore-line security/xss` over `// archguard-ignore-line`
2. Same-line for short lines, next-line for long lines
3. Python uses `#`, block comments `/* */` also work
4. After adding, re-scan to confirm suppression works
5. If many false positives of the same type, suggest disabling the rule in `.archguard.yml` instead
